# Zarf-DOS-App-K3D

In this project I created a Zarf package that harnesses Helm for deploying a Kubernetes deployment dedicated to the DOS Games Arcade containers, ensuring an efficient and scalable gaming service. The package is meticulously designed to bundle all necessary dependencies, offering a seamless installation experience. A service is automatically created as part of the deployment process, facilitating easy connectivity to the arcade platform. Utilizing zarf connect, users can effortlessly establish a connection to the service, enabling immediate access to a nostalgic gaming experience. The K3D cluster is running on Rasberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu 20.04 as the OS.
